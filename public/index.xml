      <description>Notes Chances are if you stumbled on this you are either me, I pointer you here, or my SEO is better than I thought it would be. If you are here for answers to your own questions please keep an eye on the posting date as the information I have might be dated and inaccurate. I will try my best to keep my notes updated as technology changes but feel free to also contact me if any of this is wrong.</description>
