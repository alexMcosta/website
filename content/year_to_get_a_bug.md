# Year to Get a Bug

___

I went to BsidesPDX in 2018 a month after my son was born. Having only been in the software industry a few years in support roles, I went to the conference seeing if infosec was a possible interest in pointing my career. After  feeling a lot of confusion, intimidation, and fear cybersecurity seemed beyond me. I believed it was for people who were damn near geniuses and I was worried to ask questions to anyone simply because I would not be able to carry any conversation with an InfoSec professional, novice, or someone that even managed to read a blog before showing up. I was completely out of my element and felt like a deer caught in the headlights.

I went into the CTF room and sat there with my laptop open, my palms sweating, and a sense of dread as I tried to figure out where to even start looking. I closed my laptop. I walked through the wave of security professionals, Pokemon TCG players, and Anime people to my bus stop and waited for the max to take me home.

I was defeated. 

Now in September  2019 I am sitting here looking at my work laptop that has the Bsides 2018 sticker and I get this feeling of failure that I was not even able to understand what was happening when I attended, and yet, I sit here with the sticker like I was an actual participant in the event. 

Having just read Moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua Foer and having BsidesPDX 2019 just around the corner I feel like doing something similar to what Joshua did in the year he trained to be a Memory Athlete and compete in the US Memory championship. What would it be like to spend a year training to be a bug bounty hunter? To come back to BsidesPDX in 2020 and give a presentation on going from knowing nothing about the infosec industry to being able to talk to people in the field?

Even if my presentation does not get approved I still believe this will be a fun endeavor to do for myself as a project, and will also be something that helps me grow professionally and personally and will journal it away here since I am pretty sure no one comes here anyways.
