## EC2

## Summary
EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud) is a virtual computational environment offered as a service from AWS and works as the computational mechanism in cloud environments.



### Different Types of EC2 Instances
Like most computers; AWS EC2 instances are not "One size fits all" there are multiple different types based on your cloud computing needs.

#### **General Purpose**
These are the "T" and "M" instances. They are well rounded and are great for every day use from small websites powered by "T"s to smaller web applications powered by "M"s. This is usually a great goto if you are not sure what type of instance you require.


#### **Compute Optimized**
The compute optimized instances are the "C" instances and are used for high compute workloads and offer the cheapest cost per compute. These are usually used for heavy computations like distributed analytics or large batch jobs.

#### **Memory Optimized**
These are the "R" and "X" instance types and are best thought of as being the RAM intensive instances. They are best suited for high performance databases or something else that might require a lot of RAM.

#### **Accelerated Computing**
These are the "P", "G", and "F" instances. They are best used for GPU intensive work such as Bitcoin mining, machine learning, etc.

#### **Storage Optimized**
These are the "F", "I", and "D" instances. They balance both high disk storage and competitions for running data processing applications.
