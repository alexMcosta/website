# Learn Go

___

## Introduction
This is a collection of free and or just fundamentally amazing resources to help you become an amazing Gopher. I will focus on free content, however if you are willing to spend money, the two things I recommend purchasing are this book, [The Go Programming language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440), and this series [Learn How To Code: Google's Go (golang) Programming Language](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/). They are worth every penny.

If you have Slack and are looking for a great place to talk to other Gophers then go here, [Gophers on Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/)

If you like Podcasts then I also highly recommend this one, [Go Time](https://changelog.com/gotime)
